# irc_server
IRC (Internet Relay Chat) - an application-level Protocol for exchanging messages in real-time. Designed primarily for group communication, it also allows you to communicate via private messages and exchange data, including files. IRC uses the TCP transport protocol and cryptographic TLS (optional). IRC began to gain particular popularity after Operation "Desert Storm" (1991), when messages from all over the world were collected in one place and broadcast on-line to IRC. Due to the technical simplicity of implementation, the IRC protocol was used in the organization of botnets as a means of transmitting control commands to the computers participating in the botnet from the owner. ðŸŒŽ IRC network According to the protocol specifications, an IRC network is a group of servers connected to each other. The simplest network is a single server. The network should have the form of a connected tree, in which each server is the central node for the rest of the network. A client is anything that is connected to the server, except for other servers. There are two types of customers: custom settings; service stations. Forwarding messages in the IRC network IRC provides both group and private communication. There are several possibilities for group communication. A user can send a message to a list of users, and a list is sent to the server, the server selects individual users from it, and sends a copy of the message to each of them. More efficient is the use of channels. In this case, the message is sent directly to the server, and the server sends it to all users in the channel. In both group and private communication, messages are sent to clients via the shortest path and are visible only to the sender, recipient, and incoming servers. It is also possible to send a broadcast message. Client messages regarding changes in the network state (for example, channel mode or user status) must be sent to all servers that are part of the network. All messages originating from the server must also be sent to all other servers.
